In this work, we developed the code RT-Flux-PIHM that integrates a multi-component reactive transport module (RT) with Flux-PIHM (Shi et al., 2013b), the distributed hydrological model Penn State Integrated Hydrological Model (PIHM) with a land surface module adapted from the Noah Land Surface Model (LSM). The reactive transport module enables the simulation of geochemical reactions including mineral dissolution and precipitation, redox reaction, surface complexation, cation exchange and aqueous complexation. Combined with the capability of Flux-PIHM in simulating hydrological and land surface processes, the RTM module in RT-Flux-PIHM expands our capabilities to simulate the closely coupled hydrogeochemical processes.
